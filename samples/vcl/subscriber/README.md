## Subscribing to a topic

Subscription mechanism it's event based.

``` pascal
uses
  Notify;

begin
  Ntfy.Subscribe('your-very-secret-topic', 
    procedure (AEvent: INotifyEvent)
    begin
      ShowMessage('You received a message: ' + AEvent.Title)
    end);
end;
```

You can define your own callback procedure every time a notification is fired. 

``` pascal
uses
  Notify;

  procedure YourCallBackProcedure(AEvent: INotifyEvent);
  begin
    DoSomethingWith(AEvent);
  end;

begin
  Ntfy.Subscribe('your-very-secret-topic', YourCallBackProcedure);
end;
```
